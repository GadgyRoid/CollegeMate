# Material Design based Assignment Tracker

This simple app project is a way for me to get familiar with Android and coding outside of class assignments and stuff. Being a Computer Engineering student from India has its serious lackings, and real world experience is one of them. When Google released Lollipop, I was enthralled with Lollipop and Material Design as a designer, so I decided to implement an Android app of my own to see if I could do it.

Working on this project has helped me brush up on my OOPs skills, while also working with UI/UX design, a department that any CE graduate with no experience is certainly scared about. I have also worked on ItemAnimator, RecyclerViews and ListViews alongside Lollipop only implementations like Transitions. Working on this project has been a lot of fun, and I hope to work on adding a few more features to this app (or converting this into a GTD based app which is a time management technique I use a lot). Plus, this has given me the opportunity to get acquainted with Android's little quirks (like the saveState on orientation change) and I will create a boilerplate code library for myself when I work on bigger projects. One low point on this was that I never got around to getting acquainted with Fragments, which is a feature I've been looking forward to work with for quite a long time. Maybe future updates to the app will change that, but for now, nothing is solid about the future of this app.

Basic feature list:

 * What any normal todo application will do (for now)
 * Tablet support for 7" and 10" tablets
 * Follows Material Design specifications

Below is a list of features that I would like to see implemented in the app. I will be working on adding these features one by one, and anybody who wants to help is welcome!

 * Fragments support for multipane layouts on 600+dp devices
 * GTD based implementation
 * CAB based ActionMode for ListView on the main activity
 * Better tablet layout (currently displaying activity in a Widget.AppCompat.Dialog like Google Calendar)
 * Material Design inspired animations on FAB (expanded FAB) and Hero element transitions
 * Better app smoothness 
 * Cloud support (maybe Drive)
